## Synopsis

1) CPgeneProfiler package checks for a list of CarbaPenamase (CP) genes from a list of
 genome assemblies provided in fasta file format. The CP genes are derived from ARG-annot
 database.
 
2) It reports the profile of all the CP genes available in the genome assemblies
 in the format of simple heatmap.
 
3) Apart from this, it also reports the presence of co-carriage of CP genes within
 an assembly. 
 
4) Other assembly statistics such as N50, N90, Assembly Size from the
 assembly are calculated and plots of length distribution of CP gene contigs from
 the list of assemblies are reported.  
 
 Currently the package works only on Unix system.

  ## Quick Start
```
% CPgeneProfiler("/path/Folder_with_Fasta/")
```

# Installation

## 
Install devtools first, and then need to load them:
```
install.packages(devtools)
library(devtools)
```

Then install the CPgeneProfiler package using devtools. While installing, switching off to upgrade dependencies
```
devtools::install_github("ramadatta/CPgeneProfiler",dependencies = FALSE)
```

# Check installation
Ensure you have installed the package properly:
```
?CPgeneProfiler
```
